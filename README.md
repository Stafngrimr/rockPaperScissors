Project for TOP

Works fine now. Have changed the 5 rounds to a "health bar" which is fun and it obviously goes down instead of up, but you still have to win 5 times.

Reset button works fine, resets all the variables and the only thing I'd change at this point is make the whole thing a bit prettier, and maybe even add some kind of flash when you hit/get hit.

I also imagined doing some Doom style drawings for each player that show them getting more beat up as they lose HP but that's a lot of time.. maybe in a weekend in the future.
